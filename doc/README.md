## Setup
=======
[Ion Core](http://core.ioncore.xyz/) is the original ION client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ION transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.
