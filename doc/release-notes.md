## ION Core version 5.0.99 is now available  


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Ion-Qt (on Mac) or iond/ion-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

üó∫Ô∏èIon Core üëõ is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

üó∫Ô∏èIon Core üëõ should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**


Notable Changes

Functions renamed
-----------------
Stashedsend is now Swift-X

New algorithm
-------------
We dropped MIDAS and will use DGW. More info will follow.

Automint
--------
Autominiting with zerocoin. More info will follow.

New look and design
-------------------
We have new look and desing, currently it is a dirty version. It includes new GUI layout, new colors.

Performance
-----------
Current source base is much faster and cleaner than ion's previous one. It uses all cpu's and there are 
no performance issues which we could observe, it is just much faster then previous source base.

BIP38
-----
We have BIP38 including a tool with password encryption and decrpytion features

Blockexplorer
-------------
We finaly have built in blockexplorer which works on all ion's networks.

User friendly
-------------
There are some new features which improve usability as well as user experience in general. More info to follow.

Auto Wallet Backup
---------------------
In addition to the automatic wallet backup that is done at each start of the client, a new automatic backup function has been added that will, by default, create a backup of the wallet file during each xION mint operation (xION spends which re-mint their change are also included in this). This functionality is controlled by the `-backupxion` command-line option, which defaults to `1` (enabled, auto-backup).

Users that wish to prevent this behavior (not recommended) can pass `-backupxion=0` at the command-line when starting the client, or add `backupxion=0` to their `ioncoin.conf` file.

xION Automint Calculations
---------------------
A bug in the automint calculations was made apparent on mainnet when block times exceeded expectations, resulting in xION mint transactions that were in an unconfirmed state to still be treated as if they had never been minted. This caused automint to effectively mint more than what was intended.

xION Spending Fix
---------------------
The size of xION spend transactions is knowingly larger than normal transactions, and while this was expected, a much stricter check against the scriptsig size is used for mainnet, causing the transactions to be rejected by the mempool, and thus not being packaged into any blocks.

xION Transaction Recovery
---------------------
Due to the aforementioned issue with xION spending, users may find that their attempted spends are now conflicted and xION balances are not represented as expected. "Recovery" of these transactions can be done using the following methods:

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Ion-Qt (on Mac) or
iond/ion-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

Due to the changes in the "evodb" database format introduced in this release, the
first startup of Ion Core will run a migration process which can take a few minutes
to finish. After the migration, a downgrade to an older version is only possible with
a reindex (or reindex-chainstate).

RPC Changes
---------------------
The `bip38decrypt` command has had it's parameter order changed to be more consistent with it's counterpart. The command now expects the Ion address as it's first parameter and the passphrase as it's second parameter.

See detailed [set of changes](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/compare/v0.16.1.0...dashpay:v0.16.1.1).

=======
Database space usage improvements
--------------------------------
Version 0.13.0.0 introduced a new database (evodb) which is found in the datadir of Ion Core. It turned
out that this database grows quite fast when a lot of changes inside the deterministic masternode list happen,
which is for example the case when a lot PoSe punishing/banning is happening. Such a situation happened
immediately after the activation LLMQ DKGs, causing the database to grow a lot. This release introduces
a new format in which information in "evodb" is stored, which causes it grow substantially slower.  

Version 0.14.0.0 also introduced a new database (llmq) which is also found in the datadir of Ion Core.
This database stores all LLMQ signatures for 7 days. After 7 days, a cleanup task removes old signatures.
The idea was that the "llmq" database would grow in the beginning and then stay at an approximately constant
size. The recent stress test on mainnet has however shown that the database grows too much and causes a risk
of out-of-space situations. This release will from now also remove signatures when the corresponding InstantSend
lock is fully confirmed on-chain (superseded by a ChainLock). This should remove >95% of all signatures from
the database. After the upgrade, no space saving will be observed however as this logic is only applied to new
signatures, which means that it will take 7 days until the whole "llmq" database gets to its minimum size.

DKG and LLMQ signing failures fixed
-----------------------------------
Recent stress tests have shown that masternodes start to ban each other under high load and specific situations.
This release fixes this and thus makes it a highly recommended upgrade for masternodes.

MacOS: macOS: disable AppNap during sync and mixing
---------------------------------------------------
AppNap is disabled now when Ion Core is syncing/reindexing or mixing.

Signed binaries for Windows
---------------------------
This release is the first one to include signed binaries for Windows.

New RPC command: quorum memberof <proTxHash>
--------------------------------------------
This RPC allows you to verify which quorums a masternode is supposed to be a member of. It will also show
if the masternode succesfully participated in the DKG process.

More information about number of InstantSend locks
--------------------------------------------------
The debug console will now show how many InstantSend locks Ion Core knows about. Please note that this number
does not necessarily equal the number of mempool transactions.

The "getmempoolinfo" RPC also has a new field now which shows the same information.

### Mandatory Update
___  

ION Core v5.0.99 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will have a grace period of up to two week to update their clients before enforcement of this update is enabled - a grace period that will end at block 1320000 the latest.

### How to Upgrade
___
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/ION-Qt (on Mac) or iond/ion-qt (on Linux).

### Compatibility
ION Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8th, 2014, No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

ION Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

#### Mac OSX High Sierra  
Currently there are issues with the 4.x gitian release on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.
### Atomic Token Protocol (ATP)
_____

**Introduction:**  

As part of the integration of game development functionality and blockchain technology, the ION community chose to adopt a token system as part of its blockchain core. The community approved proposal IIP 0002 was put to vote in July 2018, after which development started. Instead of developing a solution from scratch, the team assessed a number of proposals and implementations that were currently being worked on for other Bitcoin family coins. Selection criteria were:

* Fully open, with active development
* Emphasis on permissionless transactions
* Efficient in terms of resource consumption
* Simple and elegant underlying principles 

The ATP system implemented is based on the Group Tokenization proposal by Andrew Stone / BU.

**References:**

[GROUP Tokenization specification by Andrew Stone](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-yrqBJNj6oGPku49krZqTMGNNEWnUJBRFjX7fJXvTs/edit#heading=h.sn65kz74jmuf)  
[GROUP Tokenization reference implementation for Bitcoin Cash](https://github.com/gandrewstone/BitcoinUnlimited/commits/tokengroups)  

For the technical principles underlying ION Group Tokenization, the above documentation is used as our standard.

ION developers fine tuned, extended and customized the Group Tokenization implementation. This documentation aims to support the ION community in:

* Using the ION group token system
* Creating additional tests as part of the development process
* Finding new use cases that need development support
